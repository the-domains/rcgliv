_"I chose SU because I was looking for a strong International Relations major, and SU's is among the best."_

"My advice to European students who are considering SU is to buy warm clothes! I'm a first year student and have been here for only a few weeks, but it's been very easy to meet people". ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e380824f-5a57-4b41-b0dd-6132121a67ae.jpg)
