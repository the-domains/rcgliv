## Syracuse University

**Rafael Cifuentes, '16 **  
**International Relations & Economics**  
**Spain**

"My advice to European students who are considering SU is to buy warm clothes! I'm a first year student and have been here for only a few weeks, but it's been very easy to meet people. I chose SU because I was looking for a strong International Relations major, and SU's is among the best."
