________It was clear to me since I was quite Young, that in order to achieve my goals , effort, full dedication and being constant were a MUST. ________

________________One of my first objectives was to study my major in the US and being a European, it also meant dealing with english to become my true second language.__This set my mind very early to hard working through school and long summers in the UK and the US and also exposed and enriched me culturally and personally.__All efforts and hard work paid off, I am presently at Syracuse University Maxwell School Of Citizenship , graduating May 2016 in International Relations and Economics Majors.________________
