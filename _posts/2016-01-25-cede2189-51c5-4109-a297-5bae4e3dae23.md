## "Be good at what you do. You have to be passionate to be successful

_**__**_

_**My personal experience**_

_It
was clear to me since I was quite Young, that in order to achieve my goals ,
effort, full dedication and being constant were a MUST. One of my first
objectives was to study my major in the US and being a European,
also meant dealing with english to become my true second language. _

This
set my mind very early to hard working through school and long summers in the
UK and the Us and also exposed and enriched me culturally and personally.

All efforts and hard work paid off, I
am presently at Syracuse University Maxwell
School Of Citizenship , graduating May 2016 in International Relations and
Economics Majors.
