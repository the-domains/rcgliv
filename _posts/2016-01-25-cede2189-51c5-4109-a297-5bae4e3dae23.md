## "Be good at what you do. You have to be passionate to be successful

_**__**_

_It
was clear to me since I was quite Young, that in order to achieve my goals ,
effort, full dedication and being constant were a MUST. One of my first
objectives was to study my major in the US and being a European,
also meant dealing with english to become my true second language. _

_This
set my mind very early to hard working through school and long summers in the
UK and the Us and also exposed and enriched me culturally and personally._

_All efforts and hard work paid off, I
am presently at Syracuse University Maxwell
School Of Citizenship , graduating May 2016 in International Relations and
Economics Majors._
